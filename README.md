# VBA-challenge

For this homework assignment, I chose to find the moderate solution. I also had my VBA script loop through each worksheet, which was one element of the bonus. I did this by adding Dim ws as Worksheet in my Dimensions, looping through each ws in Worksheets, and adding ws. in front of each Cell and Range value throughout my VBA script.

In addition to my VBA script and this README.md file, this Repository also includes screenshots of the moderate solution for each sheet (2014, 2015, and 2016) in the Multiple_year_stock_data Excel file. I initially tested out my script on the alphabetical_testing Excel file before running it on the larger Multiple_year_stock_data file as the instructions suggested.
